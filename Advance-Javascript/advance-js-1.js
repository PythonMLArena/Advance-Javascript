// Coercion - Type Conversion 

// Whenever we do a operation based on input we can convert the input for operation, we convert type of Input, this conversion can be manually(typecasting(explicit)) done by us or 
// the language based on certain rules automatically(implicit typecasting/type conversion) convert the types[which is coercion]


// Abstract Operations
// These Operations not part of JS,these are some set of algorithms that are present in the JS Docs but they are not available for usage in JS,
// We developers cannot use these operation directly, These help the documentaion to understand lot of things internally
